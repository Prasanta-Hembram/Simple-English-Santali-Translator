# Simple-English2Santali-Translator
English2Santali Translator: It is an experimental project to learn HTML and Javascript. Already translated sentences which are placed in a decreasing order using replace() method, so that the longest translation pair would be picked up first then followed by shorter phrase/sentences.

## What is working well for now
- Abbreviations are working very well - You can give abbreviations like S.B.I which will give output as ᱮᱥ.ᱵᱤ.ᱟᱭ Keep in mind that all abbreviations should be in CAPITAL.
- Transcription - English to Santali transcription is working quite well.
- Type "what is your name?" without quote - You will get "ᱟᱢᱟᱜ ᱧᱩᱛᱩᱢ ᱫᱚ ᱪᱮᱫ ᱠᱟᱱᱟ?"
## What is not working
- Mixture of catiptal and small letter words may not transcribe well, unless that form is already present. If so then create a phrase and add it to the JS section.
- Plural form is not yet supported.

## Contribute
- You can make changes to this project by keeping everything simple and add more words/phrase/sentence to dict.js file.

## Comment
- Don't underestimate the power of this Simple Machine Translator. I think it is one of the simplest machine translation project, where anyone can create and make changes to whatever result they want with basic programming knowledge/if not they can learn by seeing the sequence which is very easy to understand. This project will boost the interest towards machine translation for those people/communities where online resources may be a limiting factor and lack of programmig knowledge.

## TODO
- Add more languages.
